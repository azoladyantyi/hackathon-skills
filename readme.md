How to create graphs in JS using Chart JS: http://www.chartjs.org/

Look at an example graph [here](https://codex-academy.github.io/hackathon-skills/)

There's some test data to create graphs for here: https://api-tutor.herokuapp.com/v1/cars

See the API data used here: https://api-tutor.herokuapp.com/ - look at the JS to see how to call the API and use the data with the DOM.

All the source code is here: https://github.com/avermeulen/api-tutor

## Sorting, grouping & finding data

## Do this

In pairs create a website with two different type of [Chart.js charts](chartjs.org)  along side each other. When the website is made smaller the graphs should be displayed below each other. Deploy the Github pages. Use data from the https://api-tutor.herokuapp.com/v1/cars API.

Create a graph for two of these:

* Cars grouped by make
* Cars grouped by colors
* Cars total cost per brand
* Cars total cost by colors
* Cars grouped by make and color
* Cars grouped by make and model
* Cars grouped by reg numbers
